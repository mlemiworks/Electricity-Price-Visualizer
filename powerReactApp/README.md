# Electricity Price Visualizer - Sähkö Tänään

This app helps you easily visualize the daily price of electricity.

I built this app primarily as an exercise to learn React and how to work with APIs. As a spot electricity user, I like to check daily electricity prices to find the cheapest hours for running power-hungry devices like dishwashers and washing machines. Most importantly, I need to know the best time to heat up my electric sauna!

I found that many other platforms are not as readable at a glance or aren't very mobile-friendly. Instead of complex graphs, this app uses a simple clockface to display AM and PM prices, making it easy to understand quickly.
